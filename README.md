# iotNetHack

Private Repo for storing my prototype network based attacking agent for IoT devices.

  
TODO:
* Start with a basic user interface

	could get a general setup through parseArgs

* Identify 4 basic attacks that I can create on the system

	Port Scan

	Denial Of Service

* Build interface from the ui program to the other scripts

	Ideally I would like to have the scripts runnable by themselves but also accessable from the main program

* Need to find out if ScaPy works on python 3.x
		If not, will need to work in py 2
		Update this is completely fine
